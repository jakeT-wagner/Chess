# Chess

Ongoing project to create a two-player chess game. Have been able to make a lot of the game, excluding check, checkmate, and other king movement checks. En passant is also currently not included in the game. 

Created using pygame in python and utilizing OOP. Made a parent class Piece, which has children for the different kinds of chess pieces. Each child has a different method for finding valid moves; however, a few other pieces have other piece-specific methods.
