# Chess

Ongoing project to create a two-player chess game. Currently working on the game mechanics. Plan to have separate piece types be children classes to the parent Piece class. I am doing this because this game works by selecting a piece, and then displaying the available moves to the user, who can then select a square to move onto. So, for different piece types, there must be a way variably return the possible valid moves to the user.
